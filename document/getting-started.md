# OpenShift Workshop For Developers

This workshop is intended to give you a hands on introduction to using OpenShift from the perspective of a developer. For developers looking to kickstart their projects, OpenShift enables efficient application development through streamlined workflows and validated integrations.

You will be learning how to package your application as a container image, deploy it on OpenShift and manage it with various tools provided by OpenShift out of the box.
