# Application Containerization

In this section, we're going to compile and build an existing simple "To Do" Java application then package the application artifact(s) as a container image.

After that we'll test the image by running it locally to make sure that our application can start and work without any error. And last but not least, we'll try to set a few application configurations via environment variables in the container itself to see how externalized configurations works.
